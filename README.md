Python automatic sporozoite tracking tool

Hello there, this is a repository, where I want to develop an automatic tracking tool for sporozoits imaged with a brightfield microscope with DIC. As I am new to the community (GitHub as well as pyhton) the progress will be slow and I might not respond to issues or similar thing yet.
For me this is more a chance to try out some things and learn more about git version control, GitHub and python. So please do not expect to much. However, as soon, as I have come up with a first version of this module I am happy and open for suggestions.
Thanks!
