Current workflow:
-mean projection
-subtract mean projection from original movie
-min projection from subtracted movie
-otsu threshold from min projection
-threshold subtracted movie
-binary closing

From here on:
-Maybe area closing?
-Or erosion?
-Or binary opening?

After that labeling. Think about what connectivity.
Then check for tracking
